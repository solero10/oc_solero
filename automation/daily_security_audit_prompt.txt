Generate the daily security report in plain language.

Requirements:
- Time window: previous 24 hours.
- Scope: all visible OpenClaw activity sources (host + Docker clone state).
- Include: Work Log overview + all 10 Security Addendum items.
- Keep wording non-technical.

Execution steps:
1) Run:
   python3 /home/kernk/.openclaw/workspace/automation/daily_security_audit.py
2) Parse REPORT_PATH from stdout.
3) Immediately push all workspace changes (including the new report) to GitHub by running:
   /home/kernk/.openclaw/workspace/automation/git_snapshot.sh report
4) If step 3 fails, include a short one-line "Git push status" note in your reply.
5) Read REPORT_PATH.
6) Return the report content as your final response, with one short opener line to Ken.
7) Include the local markdown file path at the end so it is easy to find later.
